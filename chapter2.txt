/////////////// JavaScript Expressions in JSX & ES6 Template literals ///////////////////////////


you can add any JavaScript expression in between these curly braces 

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const name = "Kashif";
const luckyNumber = 3;

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
    <p>Your Lucky Number is: {luckyNumber}</p>
    <p>some more expressions {Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}</p>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);


but we can't write JavaScript statements.

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const name = "Kashif";
const luckyNumber = 3;

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
    <p>Your Lucky Number is: {luckyNumber}</p>
    <p>some more expressions {
    if (name === "Kashif) {
	    return 5
	    } else if {
	    return 0
	    }
    }</p>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);


- Difference between Expression and Statement
    - the big difference between expressions and statements is that an expression will be evaluated to a value
    - Like it ends up, after all the code's been executed, it ends up equaling something.

    | Expressions | statements |
    | --- | --- |
    | Expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value in other word become a value | A statement is an instructions or an action |
    | Example const = 5,  2+3. function call const y = getAnswer() is also expression because it return somthing | Example conditions with if, loops with while are all statements because they just control actions, perform actions |
- Template literals or string interpolation
    - injecting string into JavaScript


    import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const fname = "Kashif";
const lname = "Abdullah";
const luckyNumber = 3;

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>
      Hello {`${fname} ${lname} `}!
    </h1>
    <p>Your Lucky Number is: {luckyNumber}</p>
    <p>some more expressions {Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}</p>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
